### Helloooo 👋

I'm Chris, a web developer from Ontario, Canada. I'm a self-taught developer pursuing a career in web dev. I enjoy building beautiful sites and apps with web technology.
I kick-started my coding journey with freeCodeCamp and claimed five of their certifications.  I currently working on personal projects in JavaScript, especially with React/Next.js, though I'm open to learning other languages and frameworks. I love the web platform and I'm excited by the powerful technolgies which can developers can efficiently build amazing sites and apps with. Lately I've been getting my feet wet with larger projects by contributing to https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso .

When I get down to coding, I enjoy the satisfaction of creating complex interaction and the eye candy of adding styles to my HTML. 

- 💬 Ask me about putting your visual design into code. I enjoy CSS, but design isn't my strength, so I'd love to implement your amazing design.
